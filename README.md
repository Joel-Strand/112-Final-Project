# 112-Final-Project
# To compile, run "javac Main.java" in the command line. To run, run "java Main <theta> < <FILEPATH>" in the command line.

Theta is a threshold value from 0-2 that determines how accurate the program will run. 0 is a brute force calculation with no approximations for efficiency. 2 reprents maximum efficiency with much approximation. Adjust theta higher or lower to make the graphics smoother depending on how many bodies are being simulated.
